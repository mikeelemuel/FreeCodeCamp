# FreeCodeCamp
This repository includes all my codes from the freecodecamp.com that would help other campers to give a hint or some helpful codes to get them through their challenges.

This is just a journal of my bootcamp from FreeCodeCamp.com and saved all my code after I solved the challenges from the  FreeCodecamp.com.

If you are a camper or someone who would like to contribute please do not hesitate to contact me. The importance of this is for everyone or the other camper to use this as their reference to get them through their challenges in freecodecamp.com.  Please take note if you find a solution that no  longer works then open an issue so I can work on it. I wasn't able to provide to update solution,  please be patient as I will  try my very best to work on the issue as much as possible. 

Please share this to your friends or the other campers and also share the online courses provided by the freecodecamp.com so it might help people on their web development skills.
