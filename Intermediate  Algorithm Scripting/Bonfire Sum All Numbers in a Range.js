/*
We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers and all numbers between them.

The lowest number will not always come first.


Your goal is to fix the failing test.
First, run all the tests by clicking "Run code" or by pressing Control + Enter
The failing test is in red. Fix the code so that all tests pass. Then you can move on to the next
Bonfire.
