/*
Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

The provided number may not be a prime.

Your goal is to fix the failing test.
First, run all the tests by clicking "Run code" or by pressing Control + Enter
The failing test is in red. Fix the code so that all tests pass. Then you can move on to the next
