/*
Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. The returned value should be a number.

For example, getIndexToIns([1,2,3,4], 1.5) should return 1 because it is greater than 1 (index 0), but less than 2 (index 1).

Likewise, getIndexToIns([20,3,5], 19) should return 2 because once the array has been sorted it will look like [3,5,20] and 19 is less than 20 (index 2) and greater than 5 (index 1).

Your goal is to fix the failing test.
First, run all the tests by clicking "Run code" or by pressing Control + Enter
The failing test is in red. Fix the code so that all tests pass. Then you can move on to the next
Bonfire.
